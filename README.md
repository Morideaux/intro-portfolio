# Intro Portfolio

## Description

This is a basic portfolio site ment to practice introductory concepts

The overall intent of this project is to:

- Further familiarize myself with basic HTML and CSS

Ultimately, this project is to serve as the baseline for a more daring and inventive protfolio down the line while still displaying that I have learned and understand early HTML and CSS.
